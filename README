Marine Regions Named Entity Recognizer

Erwin Marsi - 2016

Exploratory code to detect and link named entities from Marine Regions gazetteer
(http://www.marineregions.org/gazetteer.php?p=search) in raw text.

Requires an export of fiels the Marine Regions database in CVS format with field
MRGID, GeoName, Language and Placetype.

This is very much experimental and certainly not fit for production.
